## Description
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

Male
Sunday: Kwasi

Monday: Kwadwo

Tuesday: Kwabena

Wednesday: Kwaku

Thursday:  Yaw

Friday: Kofi

Saturday: Kwame

Female
Sunday: Akosua

Monday: Adwoa

Tuesday: Abenaa

Wednesday: Akua

Thursday:  Yaa

Friday: Afua

Saturday: Ama

Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. This application is built for this USER STORY

 User requests to be able to:-

 a) Enter my birthday through a form.

 b)Choose what gender I am.



## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid.


        -Open the code with VSCode
        -Enter dates that are valid as per the annual calender
        - Go Live

         
0
* The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
